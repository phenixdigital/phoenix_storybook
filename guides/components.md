# Component stories

Basic component documentation is in `PhxLiveStorybook.Story`.

## Variation groups

You may want to present different variations of a component in a single variation block.
It is possible using `PhxLiveStorybook.VariationGroup`.

## Container

By default, each `variation` is rendered within a `div` in the storybook DOM.
If you need further _sandboxing_ you can opt in for `iframe` rendering.

```elixir
# storybook/my_component.story.exs
defmodule Storybook.MyComponent do
  use PhxLiveStorybook.Story, :component

  def function, do: &MyComponent.my_component/1
  def container, do: :iframe
end
```

ℹ️ Learn more on this topic in the [sandboxing guide](sandboxing.md).

## Aliases & Imports

When using nested components or JS commands, you might need to reference other functions or
components. Whilst it is possible to use fully qualified module names, you might want to provide
custom _aliases_ and _imports_.

Here is an example defining both:

```elixir
defmodule NestedComponent do
  use PhxLiveStorybook.Story, :component
  def function, do: &NestedComponent.nested_component/1

  def aliases, do: [MyStorybook.Helpers.JSHelpers]
  def imports, do: [{NestedComponent, nested: 1}]

  def variations do
    [
      %Variation{
        id: :default,
        slots: [
          """
          <.nested phx-click={JSHelpers.toggle()}>hello</.nested>
          <.nested phx-click={JSHelpers.toggle()}>world</.nested>
          """
        ]
      }
    ]
  end
end
```

## Templates

You may want to render your components within some wrapping markup. For instance, when your
component can only be used as a slot of another enclosing component.

Some components, such as _modals_, _slideovers_, and _notifications_, are not visible from the
start: they first need user interaction. Such components can be accompanied by an outer template,
that will for instance render a button next to the component, to toggle its visibility state.

### Variation templates

You can define a template in your component story by defining a `template/0` function.
Every variation will be rendered within the defined template, the variation itself is injected
in place of `<.lsb-variation/>`.

```elixir
def template do
  """
  <div class="my-custom-wrapper">
    <.lsb-variation/>
  </div>
  """
end
```

You can also override the template, per variation or variation_group by setting the `:template` key
to your variation. Setting it to a falsy value will disable templating for this variation.

### Variation group templates

Variation groups can also leverage on templating:

- either by wrapping every variation in their own template.

```elixir
"""
<div class="one-wrapper-for-each-variation">
  <.lsb-variation/>
</div>
"""
```

- or by wrapping all variations as a whole, in a single template.

```elixir
"""
<div class="a-single-wrapper-for-all">
  <.lsb-variation-group/>
</div>
"""
```

If you want to get unique id, you can use `:variation_id` that will be replaced, at rendering time
by the current variation (or variation group) id.

### Placeholder attributes

In template, you can pass some extra attributes to your variation. Just add them to the
`.lsb-variation` or `.lsb-variation-group` placeholder.

```elixir
"""
<.form_for for={:user} let={f}>
  <.lsb-variation form={f}/>
</.form>
"""
```

### JS-controlled visibility

Here is an example of templated component managing its visibility client-side, by toggling CSS
classes through [JS commands](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.JS.html).

```elixir
defmodule Storybook.Components.Modal do
  use PhxLiveStorybook.Story, :component

  def function, do: &Components.Modal.modal/1

  def template do
    """
    <div>
      <button phx-click={Modal.show_modal()}>Open modal</button>
      <.lsb-variation/>
    </div>
    """
  end

  def variations do
    [
      %Variation{
        id: :default_modal,
        slots: ["<:body>hello world</:body>"]
      }
    ]
  end
end
```

### Elixir-controlled visibility

Some components don't rely on JS commands but need external assigns, like a modal that takes a
`show={true}` or `show={false}` assign to manage its visibility state.

`PhxLiveStorybook` handles special `assign` and `toggle` events that you
can leverage on to update some properties that will be passed to your components as _extra assigns_.

```elixir
defmodule Storybook.Components.Slideover do
  use PhxLiveStorybook.Story, :component
  def function, do: &Components.Slideover.slideover/1

  def template do
    """
    <div>
      <button phx-click={JS.push("assign", value: %{show: true})}>
        Open slideover
      </button>
      <.lsb-variation/>
    </div>
    """
  end

  def variations do
    [
      %Variation{
        id: :default_slideover,
        attributes: %{
          close_event: JS.push("assign", value: %{variation_id: :default_slideover, show: false})
        },
        slots: ["<:body>Hello world</:body>"]
      }
    ]
  end
end
```

### Template code preview

By default, the code preview will render the variation and its template markup as well.
You can choose to render only the variation markup, without its surrounding template by using the
`lsb-code-hidden` HTML attribute.

```elixir
"""
<div lsb-code-hidden>
  <button phx-click={Modal.show_modal()}>Open modal</button>
  <.lsb-variation/>
</div>
"""
```

## Block, slots & let

Liveview let you define blocks of HEEx content in your components, referred to as as slots.
They can be passed in your variations with the `:slots` keys :

```elixir
%Variation{
  id: :modal,
  slots: [
    """
    <:button>
      <button type="button">Cancel</button>
    </:button>
    """,
    """
    <:button>
      <button type="button">OK</button>
    </:button>
    """
  ]
}
```

You can also use [LiveView let mechanism](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.Component.html#module-default-slots)
to pass data to your default block. You just need to **declare the let attribute** you are using in
your variation.

```elixir
%Variation{
  id: :list,
  attributes: %{stories: ~w(apple banana cherry)},
  let: :entry,
  slots: [
    "I like <%= entry %>"
  ]
}
```

`let` syntax can also be used with named slots, but requires no specific livebook setup.

```elixir
%Variation{
  id: :table,
  attributes: %{
    rows: [
      %{first_name: "Jean", last_name: "Dupont"},
      %{first_name: "Sam", last_name: "Smith"}
    ]
  },
  slots: [
    """
    <:col let={user} label="First name">
      <%= user.first_name %>
    </:col>
    """,
    """
    <:col let={user} label="Last name">
      <%= user.last_name %>
    </:col>
    """
  ]
}
```
